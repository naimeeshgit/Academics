<p>Just run the jupyter notebook file given in the same directory</p>
<h1 id="contents">Contents</h1>
<p>The folder contains the plots as asked in the question in the Reports folder.</p>

<ul>
<li>Calculating Integration using MonteCarlo Method for equations in 1 and 2 variables (the two parts of the question)</li>
<li>Created a standard function for computing the integral in both cases</li>
<li>Standard deviation from the plots is seen to be <strong>inversely proportional</strong> to sqrt(N)</li>
<li>As we increase the value of N, we see that the value of the integral converges better. Increasing the number of trials works better</li>
