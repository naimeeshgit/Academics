<p>Just run the jupyter notebook file given in the same directory</p>
<h1 id="contents">Contents</h1>
<p>The folder contains Reports folder containing the plots showing the phase-space trajectory and the mean squared displacement of the particle.</p>
<h1 id="results">Results</h1>
<ul>
<li>We had initialized the constants like H, k, m from before hand. As seen from the plots, we do get the elliptical path for the phase-space trajectory.</li>
<li>For the mean squared displacement plot, since it is only one particle, it becomes a <strong>squared displacement plot</strong>. It is the shape of a cosing wave.</li>
<li>As the value of H gets higher, both the ellipses and cosing waves get larger.</li>
</ul>
