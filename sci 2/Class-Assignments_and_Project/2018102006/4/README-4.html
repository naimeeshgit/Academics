<p>The folder contains Reports folder containing the plots showing the Numerical solutions for 1D and 2D differential equations.</p>

<ul>
<li>The plot is for different time stamps. The length of the box (2D/3D for 1D/2D diffusion equations respectively) is fixed.</li>
<li>The values for diffiusion constants and dt, dx, length of box and time stamp have been fixed.</li>
<li>As the time stamp increases, we see a more flattened graph.</li>
<li>This is due to the fact that as time goes, the particles diffuse throughout the medium</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: The values for dx, dt have to be chosen carefully, otherwise we might get an oscillatory graph</p>
