<ul>
<li>As the temperature increases, the kinetic energy of the particles increases. As a results, we see an increase (negative increase) in the energy in <strong>Energy vs Temperature</strong> plot</li>
<li>Due to the increased kinetic energy, the spin of the particles cannot couple and the magnetization reduces. This is responded by the plot of <strong>Magnetization vs Temperature</strong> plot</li>
